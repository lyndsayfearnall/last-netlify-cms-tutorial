The London Squash & Fitness Club (LSFC) was founded in September 1966 and has maintained a focus on squash and fitness as a non-profit, member-owned organization.

The club’s facilities at 76 Albert Street in London, Ontario were originally a family home – creating a unique warmth and charm. With expansions over the years, including over half a million dollars in facility upgrades in 2011, the LSFC now features four international singles courts (two glass-backed) and one glass-backed North American doubles court. It has a well equipped fitness center on the second floor, and a main floor club lounge with a fully licensed bar.

The true magic of the club, however, comes from its 300+ members. They create a welcoming environment that fosters a healthy sense of competition for seasoned squash players, a supportive culture for those just taking up the game, and a warm social ambience for all. The club is active throughout the year with member ladders, club tournaments, city league matches, exhibitions, and social events. An annual highlight is the Nash Cup – a PSA and WSA sanctioned tournament that brings some of the world’s top male and female squash professionals to the club.
